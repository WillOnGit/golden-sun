*     About this Guide     *
****************************

This guide is to help people find the tricky djinn they missed.
Listed here are all 44 djinn you'll find in Golden Sun: The Lost Age.
If you transferred data from Golden Sun, you can get 72 djinn in total.
I also listed their Japanese names since some walkthroughs are still using
them.

BTW, no matter how many times you play, djinn are always at the place they
should be. There's no way they'll appear in different places.
Field djinn might appear a few steps from the place other people find them,
 but at least it's still in the same forest.

If you feel the description is not clear enough, or corrections are needed,
feel free to e-mail me at shiningshizuko@hotmail.com

******************************

Since most of the places can be visited in no particular order,
 there's no such thing as a clear cut order on when you get these djinn.
The order listed here is my suggested best order.

However, the gncheckpoint should be useful.

To get there, walk west when you come to a road fork when leaving Daila.

Chase it around. Use the torch to block its escape route.

Cannon (Mars #1)
----------------
Dehkan Plateau.
To get there, walk east when you come to a road fork when leaving Daila.

*****************************************************************************


*******************************************************************
*     Djinn you get without transferring data from Golden Sun     *
*******************************************************************

Isaac & Co. bring only 18 Djinn if you don't transfer data.
There are one more of each kind in GS:TLA:
 - Venus: Treasure Isle.
 - Mars: Magma Rock.
 - Jupiter: SW Ateka Islet.
            At the top of the cliff, there's a round rock that you can lift.
            Lift the rock and walk to the left side of the waterfall.
 - Mercury: Prox Village.
            Find the house where there are two people talking outside.
            Walk in and a Mercury Djinn is right there.

Note that these 4 places are special VIP seats reserved for djinn of GS1.
This is a chance for players to make up for their mistakes,
 not for some gnbonus or whatsoever.
If you have all 7 djinn of each element, there WON'T be any djinn there.
It's perfectly normal if you don't see any djinn at these 4 places.
If you missed a GS:TLA djinn, look at the list and get the djinn at where
 it's supposed to be. NOT these 4 places. 

I don't believe you can get all 10 djinn you lack from GS1.
Because gnUpdate can be done anytime before Isaac joins,
 the game won't know if you'll update at the last minute or not.
Therefore, if you want to get an GS1 djinn,
 it must be in places where you can't reach without Isaac.
And there aren't may places left.
If there's any more GS1 djinn, please mail me a save file (preferred)
 or a screenshot of the location.
I'll add it to this FAQ and give you credits. :)
