==============
== FOREWORD ==
==============
  So, what's there to say?  The Lost Age is by far a sequel in every way,
from the progression of plot, to the fact that everything about it is bigger
and arguably better.  It's a more well rounded game than before.  And since
nothing has changed (with the exception of a few retranslations of some
names), we are left with the new stuff.  Each of which add their own simple
mechanisms to the whole and contrive to make the whole thing that much more
complicated.

  I have to admit, I wasn't sure if I was going to write this or not.  But
it was when I realised that I used my original guide as much for my own
benefit as for others that I knew I had to do it.  How else would I be so
sure about what classes I really should be using?

  Forgive me for copying and pasting some explanation sections from my
original guide.  Most of what holds true in Golden Sun also holds true for
The Lost Age, so there really was no point in rewriting some of the old
stuff.  The important changes are all in the data, which I *have* fully
updated.

  Note: Fair warning.  It is best to view this document in a non-proportional
font.  Doing otherwise will severely mess up the tables to follow.  By
default, your web browser will probably be using something like Courier New,
so this won't be a problem.  But if the FAQ looks messed up, try messing with
your browser's font options.

  And Fair Warning Part Two: Although I've tried my best to be as accurate as
possible, mistakes may have creeped in.  There's only so much testing you can
do in so little time, and I have tried to get this out as fast as possible.
However, the calculations behind much of what happens in battle are
complicated, so before you decide you've found a mistake, be doubly sure that
you've done everything as noted in the guide.

======================
== THE CLASS SYSTEM ==
======================
  With the introduction of the new max of 9 Djinn per character, as well as
the new Class Items, the rules for classes have got slightly more complex.
However, the basics behind this remain the same.

  The primary force behind the class system is the allocation of the Djinn to
each character.  Through combinations of anywhere up to 9 Djinn at once, it
is possible to unlock any of up to 34 classes per character.  In addition,
with the various Class Items equipped, you can unlock a further 12 classes
(3 Class Items each with 4 levels).  This leads to a total of 110 different
classes, since certain characters share classes with others.

  Becoming a new class adjusts your stats quite radically, as we shall see in
the tables below.  However, before moving on, it is vital that a few concepts
are explained.

  First, each character has a hidden set of 'base stats'.  These stats are
what are adjusted each time you gain a level or use a stat-enhancing item.
These base stats are then further adjusted by the class you're at and the
Djinni you have equipped.

  The stat you actually see is worked out in the following manner:
   (Base Stat + Djinni Bonuses + Equip Bonus) * Class Bonus

  Your Base Stats can only be changed in the two ways already listed:
levelling up and using stat up items.  Your current class will *NOT* affect
how you level up.  We will look at how levelling up will affect your Base
Stats in the next section.

  The Djinni Bonuses are hardcoded and are the same for everyone, but they
differ on the exact Djinni.  Because of this, it is often worth experimenting
with which exact Djinni of the same element you should set on a character;
Mist, for example, is ill-suited for a spellcasting character when compared
to Fizz.

  The Class Bonus is multiplied to all the other Bonuses applied to your
Base Stat, and this includes the Djinni Bonus, so you are unlikely to see the
exact bonuses shown below each time.  A Class with a 150% HP Bonus will see
more benefit to HP from a Djinni than one with only a 100% HP Bonus.  The
same follows with stat-enhancing items; since they affect the base stat only,
characters with high Class Bonuses will see a better effect.

  You may have also noticed that the Details section of weapons and armor
doesn't seem to match the actual bonuses you receive.  This is, again, due to
the Class Bonus.  Because of this, you will note that it is vital in the
later stages of the game to pick the correct class, depending on your playing
style.

  With these basics out of the way, it's time for some actual data.  Let's
continue.
  


==============================
== BASE STATS AND LEVEL UPS ==
==============================
  At the start of Lost Age, your characters are given the following base
stats:

                    HP    PP    Att    Def    Agi    Lck
  Isaac             30    20     13      6      8      3
  Garet             33    18     11      8      6      2
  Ivan              28    24      8      4     11      4
  Mia               29    23      9      5      7      5

  Felix             32    19     13      6      7      2
  Jenna             29    21     10      5      8      4
  Sheba             28    24      8      4     10      5
  Piers             30    19     11      7      6      3


  These are the characters' Level 0 stats.  The very base they start from.

  As soon as you hit New Game, they are then levelled up to the following
levels:

                Isaac:  L28                Felix:  L 5
                Garet:  L28                Jenna:  L 5
                Ivan:   L28                Sheba:  L 5
                Mia:    L28                Piers:  L18


  The way characters' level up bears looking at at this point.  It is done
via a Goal system; each character has a stat value at specified goal levels
that gives them a rough path to follow.

  However, there is a slight random variation to it.  Let us go through an
example.

  An L0 Isaac's last goal was his base, which was 30 HP.  His next goal
target is at L19 is 182.  That's a difference of 152 HP.  This 152 is the
magic number.

  The game divides this difference over 20 levels (it doesn't matter that
you only get 19 levels between L0 and L19, it's still divided by 20).  So,
152 divided by 20 gives us 7.6 per level.

  This is where the random variance comes in.  The fractional part of the
division we did just a second ago is your percentage chance that you will
actually round up instead of down.  You have a 60% chance of getting 8 during
a level up during that period between L0 and L19.  It follows, of course,
that you have a 40% chance of getting a 7 instead.

  This goes for all the characters with all the stats.  You always have a
percentage chance of either rounding up, or rounding down.

  One slight technicality that should be mentioned is that although I said
a percentage chance, this is actually a chance out of 256.  So it isn't
*exactly* 60%.  Because of this, the chances are often slightly skewed one
way or another.

  Let's summarise through some formulas:

    Let x = Last Goal
    Let y = Next Goal

    Difference            = d = (y - x)
    Base Growth per Level = b = [d / 20]
    Chance of gaining
      additional +1       = c = (d - 20b) * 256 / 20, rounded to
      out of 256                                         nearest integer


  So, looking at our last example:

    x =  30
    y = 182

    d = (182 - 30)
      = 152
    b = [152 / 20]
      = [7.6]
      = 7
    c = ((152 - 20*7) * 256 / 20)
      = (12 * 256 / 20)
      = 153.6
      = 154 after rounding to nearest integer

  Thus, we discover there is exactly a 154/256 chance of getting a 8 rather
than a 7 when Isaac levels up between L0-L19.


  We shall now move on to the important data.  The first set of tables will
show the goal points for *each* stat for all characters.  This could be said
to be the *average* stat that character should have at that level.  (Note,
however, that because the first section only covers levelling up to levels
1-19, that the true average will be the goal value minus the average level
up value from L0-19)

  The second set of tables will be more focused on the actual levelling up,
informing you of the minimum stat up and chance to hit the maximum for each
stat for each character.

  Luck will be absent from both the first and second tables, since the L0
value was given above and it stays the same through all level ups.

  The third and final set of tables will simply give the full range and
average stat each character will have at the start of Lost Age.

  Let's begin.

LEVEL UP TABLES
===============
  Under each column, the leftmost number is the base growth (b), and the
rightmost number is the chance out of 256 (c) of getting 'b+1' in this level
range.  A row of dashes ('---') means that the chance of getting a higher
value than the base growth is 0.

  If you have transferred data from the original Golden Sun, then Isaac,
Garet, Ivan and Mia will have stats reflecting exactly what you transferred
over.  However, if you used a Bronze Password, note that Isaac's party will
only have their *levels* updated.  Their stats will instead be within the
ranges defined above.  This can have advantages or disadvantages, depending
on what level your party was when you transferred.



====================
== DJINNI BONUSES ==
====================
  This section lists the slight bonuses each individual Djinni gives when
set.  Again, Class Bonuses are by far the easiest way to upgrade stats, but
with a full set of 9 Djinn on a character, these small bonuses can add up
pretty nicely.

  For each element, I have listed the Djinn in the order they are placed in
the game: the original 7 first, followed by the new 11 in The Lost Age.

  The following abbreviations are used both here and
throughout this document:
   HP: Hit Points
   PP: Psynergy Points
  Att: Attack
  Def: Defense
  Agi: Agility
  Lck: Luck

======================
== ELEMENTAL LEVELS ==
======================
  Setting Djinn on a character not only allows you to unleash their unique
effect in battle: it also changes your Elemental Levels.

  Elemental Levels are a simple numerical representation of how aligned to a
particular element a character is.  Each level in a particular element grants
you an extra +5 Power and +5 Resist to that element.  In addition, elemental
levels are *required* to use the different classes in the game.

  All the characters start off with 5 levels in a particular element, and 0
levels in all others.  The characters and their respective elements are:

    Name     Element
     Felix    Earth
     Piers    Water
     Jenna    Fire
     Sheba    Wind

     Isaac    Earth
     Mia      Water
     Garet    Fire
     Ivan     Wind


  The above table illustrates each character's *Primary* element, which will
become important when we look at classes later.

  In addition to having starting elemental levels, each character has the
following base Power and Resist for each element, depending on their own
primary element.  (Note that this does *not* include the +25 to Power and
Resist the character gets for the element they have L5 in.)

                 Earth        Water          Fire          Wind
   Primary   Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist
    Earth      79    89      78    88      76    86      77    87
    Water      78    88      79    89      77    87      76    86
    Fire       76    86      77    87      79    89      78    88
    Wind       77    87      76    86      78    88      79    89



============================
== CLASS BONUSES AND REQS ==
============================
  A departure from my previous document.  To start with, I'm going to work
to be slightly more accurate to the way the Lost Age actually works out
classes.  This will have a major impact on the Class Requirements, but do
not fear; I shall also have a clearer list regarding Djinni requirements
afterwards.  You will see what I mean shortly.

  All Class Bonuses are portrayed as a percentage.  100% means that there is
no change to the Base Stats.  150% would indicate a multiplier of 1.5.
Higher bonuses are thus highly desirable.  Keep in mind though that there are
two parts to each class; the bonuses they grant, and the abilities they give.
Sometimes, the abilities of one class can outweigh the bonuses of another
class.

  The Class Requirements are listed to the right of the Bonus Stats of each
class in the following tables.  All classes require a minimum *Element Level*
in one or more elements.  Each character has a basic Element Level of 5 in
their primary element.  You gain an additional Element Level for each Djinni
you equip of that element.

  Furthermore, to achieve a class listed in any of the tables, an additional
requirement is needed.  This requirement is usually Dominance: a measure of
which element the character is currently best at.  We will discuss Dominance
after the tables.

  Finally, certain classes of the same name are in fact different classes.
The following labels will be used to differentiate them:

  (F): Fire Aligned
  (E): Earth Aligned
  (W): Water Aligned
  (A): Wind(Air) Aligned
  (D): Medium Upgrade Class Only
  (I): Item Class Only



  With those explanations out of the way, here are the actual stats.

  Now for Dominance.  First, we define each elements relationship with the
others.  Please keep in mind though, that these are story-based
relationships; they don't really have that much to do with actual damage,
which we will be covering later:

                 Primary   Neutral   Weakness  Affinity
                  Earth     Water      Wind      Fire
                  Water     Earth      Fire      Wind
                   Fire      Wind     Water     Earth
                   Wind      Fire     Earth     Water

  Dominance is defined in the following order:
     Primary dominates Neutral dominates Weakness dominates Affinity

  You may notice that this is the same order your default Power and Resist
stats are in (Primary: 79/89, Neutral: 78/88, Weakness: 77/87,
Affinity: 76/86).

  The above order means that if you have equal elemental level in two or more
elements, whichever is most dominant is what you're 'aligned' with.  At any
time, you will have two dominant elements: First Dominant and Second
Dominant.  The element in which you have the highest Elemental Level is your
First Dominant, and your second highest is your Second Dominant.  Ties are,
of course, worked out by the above Dominance order.

  With the above in mind, the tables that have been listed are used as such:

 1. If you have only Primary Djinn set, you will receive a class from the
      Basic Element Classes.
  a. Jenna and Piers are exceptions, and instead receive their class from the
       Lost Age New Classes table.
 2. If the above doesn't hold (you have at least one non-Primary Djinni set)
      then we check if your Affinity Element is either your First or Second
      Dominant.  If it is, you will receive a class from the Earth/Fire Table
      or the Wind/Water Table, depending on which group your Affinity is
      from.
 3. Otherwise, we pick from the table aligned with your Secondary Dominant.
      It is impossible for any character to be able to select a class from
      the table aligned solely with their Affinity Element, as seen by the
      rules above.
    (Example: Felix with Wind as First Dominant and Earth as Second Dominant
      would pick from the Earth Aligned Table)    

  There is one final exception: if you have an Class Item equipped, then
you will be forced into the relevant class from the Class Item Table.
Mysterious Card pushes you into the Pierrot group, Trainer's Whip into the
Tamer group, and Tomegathericon into the Dark Mage (I) group.

  To summarise:
    1. You will get an Item Required class if you have the relevant Class
         Item equipped.
    2. You will get a Basic Element class if you have only Primary Djinn set.
    3. You will get a Primary/Affinity class if your Affinity is your First
         or Second Dominant.
    4. You will get a Second Dominant aligned class if all of the above is
         false.


  Once a table has been chosen, you will be assigned the one nearest the
bottom of the table whose Elemental Level requirements you meet.  The lower
it is listed in the table, the higher these requirements are, obviously.



         ----------------------------------------------------------         



  While that clears up the different class paths available in the game, it
is not so clear when it comes to how many Djinn you should equip to any one
character.  Fortunately, because of the way the requirements work, all
characters can change into only 46 of the 110 classes available, and the
formation of this can be defined via the following:


  Using the Relationship table defined within the Dominance section, we can
list each Class in the game with regards to what the character's primary
element is, and how many of each type of Djinni they have equipped.

  Thus, depending on how many of the above Djinni types a character has
equipped, they will earn the following classes:

  In addition, as noted previously, Jenna and Piers have unique

  Finally, each of the classes that require an item (Pierrot, Tamer and Dark
Mage (I)) will upgrade to:

   2nd Level when you have 1 each of Affinity, Weakness and Neutral Djinn
   3rd Level when you have 2 each of Affinity, Weakness and Neutral Djinn
   4th Level when you have 3 each of Affinity, Weakness and Neutral Djinn


  I apologise for the format of the tables and the moderate degree of working
out you will have to do to find out exactly what you want.  However, it was
the only sensible way to keep this document from overflowing from size alone.



=====================
== CLASS ABILITIES == 
=====================
  Class abilities work largely on the concept of inheritance.  In addition to
inheritance, what abilities you can unlock is wholly dependant on your class
and your level.

  The concept of inheritance is simple to explain.  There are several
categories of classes, and each of these classes start from a basic class
which slowly upgrades through more advanced versions to a 'master' version.
As an example, Knight is an upgrade from Squire.  Thus, Knight is considered
to inherit Squire's abilities.  Knight thus learns everything Squire does at
the exact same level Squire does.

  A special concept of inheritance, new to Lost Age, is called Upgrading.
This takes a previous lower level version of the spell from a lower level
class, and upgrades it to a more powerful form.  Ragnarok, for instance, is
Upgraded to Odyssey upon attaining the Lord class.  You thus gain the
Psynergy Odyssey, yet lose Ragnarok.

  It is also possible for a class to add more abilities on top of what it
inherets.  Gallant is a good example; it learns everything Knight does, but
adds Revive and the Gaia series of spells.  In addition to this, the
characters themselves sometimes have Inherent Psynergies.  These are Psynergy
that they know and learn regardless of which class they are in.

  The other concept mentioned above was the place of level in learning
abilities.  While your class unlocks the potential to learn better abilities,
you will be unable to see or use many of them until you reach the level
indicated by that ability.  As an example, Gallant learns Gaia at level 7,
Revive at level 19, Mother Gaia at level 24 and Grand Gaia at level 54.  Not
all classes learn the same ability at the same level either: Felix will learn
Gaia sooner if he's an Apprentice than if he's a Gallant.  (We shall ignore
the fact that you'll probably be long past level 7 by the time you get 4
Earth Djinn....)

  Note that you only require the level to have access to the ability.  You do
not have to gain that level in any particular class.  If you gained L54 in
Squire, for example, then you will still know all the spells in the game; it
is just that you can only use the spells that your current class allows.
This is why when you change classes, it will tell you what Psynergy you will
lose and what Psynergy you will gain.

  Psynergy gained will be displayed in level order against the class in the
group that first earns it.  Any Psynergy that upgrades will be shown as
[Old --> New] in the list.  All classes in the same group are assumed to
inherit all the abilities from the previous classes in the group.  (An
example group is Squire, Knight, Gallant, Lord, Slayer.)

  In any case, on to the lists.

  !!NOTE!!  There are two abilities called Blast in the game, each with
different effects.  The Blast in the Blast/Nova/Supernova series will be
identified as Blast(Nova).

=======================
== DAMAGE OF ATTACKS ==
=======================
  Damage hasn't changed one bit from Golden Sun to Lost Age, so again, allow
me to just reiterate what has gone before.


  The way damage works in Golden Sun is, again, relatively straightforward.
While this document focuses on Djinn and Psynergy, a brief exploration on
how normal damage work is useful for this section.


  First, two variables must be defined: Relative Attack and Relative Power.
Relative Attack is equal to (User's Attack - Target's Defense).  It has no
upper limit, but cannot be less than 0.  Thus:
    Relative Attack = (User's Attack - Target's Defense).
    If (Relative Attack < 0), Relative Attack = 0.

  Relative Power is equal to (User's Power - Target's Resist) for a specific
element.  It cannot be greater than 200 and cannot be less than -200.  Thus:
    Relative Power = (User's Power - Target's Resist).
    If (Relative Power < -200), Relative Power = -200.
    If (Relative Power > 200), Relative Power = 200.



  Physical attacks are based on Relative Attack.  They have a Base Damage
which is equal to (Relative Attack / 2).

  A short explanation of random damage is now necessary.  In addition to any
base damage you do, an extra 0 to 3 damage is always done with each attack.
Thus, a base damage of 1000 will actually do between 1000 - 1003.  Similarly,
a base damage of 0 will actually do between 0 - 3.  (Note: Any attack that
ends up doing 0 damage will do 1 damage instead, unless the attack is
evaded.)

  Special physical attacks take this Base Damage and modify it with two
variables: Mult Mod and Add Mod.  The formula used is:
    Base Damage * Mult Mod + Add Mod

  Critical hits have an inherent Mult Mod of 1.25.  In addition to this,
they have a variable Add Mod that depends on the target's Level: the formula
being Add Mod = Target's Level / 5 + 6.

  As an example, if the Base Damage was 200, and the target's Level was 47,
then the Add Mod would be 15, and the Critical Hit damage would be:
200 * 1.25 + 15 = 265.  The random damage would then be applied to this,
giving a final damage of 265 - 268.



  Elemental Physical Attacks are dealt with in the same way, but have the
following extra rule; once the Add Mod and Mult Mod have been applied,
Relative Power is then used to determine the Elemental Damage.  A Power
Multiplier is used for this, using the following formula:
    Power Multiplier = 1 + Relative Power / 400

  This Power Mutliplier is multiplied to the damage, giving a range of 50% to
150% for the final value.  Weapon Specials, in addition to having their own
Mult Mod and Add Mod, always have an element to go with it.  Also, some
weapons also have their normal attack considered as an Elemental Physical
Attack too; Gaia Blade and Crystal Rod being notable examples.  Also, certain
spells are also considered to be Elemental Physical Attacks.

  Naturally, any Elemental Physical Attack that does not have an attached
element is simply a Special physical attack, as described in the previous
section; they completely ignore Relative Power.

  

  Psynergy or Magical attacks are based on Relative Power, but also have an
extra attribute: Base Damage.

  The Base Damage is the most important value, and signifies the average
damage the spell can do.  That spell is then modified according to the
Relative Power.  Obviously, this Relative Power depends on the Element of the
Psynergy ability.

  The formula behind this is simple; we create a Power Multiplier from:
    1 + Relative Power / 200

  This Power Multiplier obviously cannot be below 0 or above 2.  The
Multiplier is then applied to the Base Damage of the attack, which gives the
final damage done to the target.

  Psynergy Attacks are also subject to area attack reductions.  See the last
part of this section for details of this.  This only affects Psynergy spells
that use the Power Multiplier in their formulas, and it doesn't affect those
abilities that hit A(ll) targets.

  Once again, remember that random damage also applies to Psynergy Attacks,
so a number between 0 - 3 is added to the final damage.



  One more main category is Curative abilities.  They work similarly to
Magical attacks, except that since the target's Resist isn't important, a
different Power Multiplier is used:
    Power Multiplier = User's Power / 100

  This Power Multiplier cannot be greater than 2.  The amount healed is
always Base Damage * Power Multiplier, regardless of Resist.  Random damage
applies, as always.

  Note, however, that Curative abilities used outside of battle do not add
random damage and always have a Power Multiplier of 1.



  Finally, as mentioned above, area spells have a damage reduction based on
target placement.  The standard ratio is that the target chosen will take
full 100% damage before random variation, and then for each space away from
the centre of the blast, each target will take 20% less damage before random
damage is added.  The minimum damage that will be taken is limited to 10%.

  As a graphical example, here's the damage distribution for a Radius 6
attack that hits 7 targets:
                                   Centre  
       10%   20%   40%   60%   80%  100%   80%   60%   40%   20%   10%


  There are three exceptions to the above.

  Attacks that I list as (D)iminishing have a different ratio which is as
follows:
                                   Centre  
       10%   10%   10%   30%   50%  100%   50%   30%   10%   10%   10%


  Summons use yet another diminishing ratio, using a Ratio 6 attack which is
as follows:
                                   Centre
       10%   20%   30%   40%   70%  100%   70%   40%   30%   20%   10%



  And the final exception is that none of the area reduction formulas affect
any of the following:
    1. Abilities that don't do normal damage.  Example: Blunt.
    2. Elemental Physical Attacks.  Example: Shuriken.
    3. A(ll) Target spells.


  The three different reduction ratios can be graphically depicted like so:

 100%        :                        :                        :
  80%        :                       .:.                      :::
  60%       .:.                      :::                     :::::
  40%      .:::.                   .:::::.                  :::::::
  20%   ...:::::...              .:::::::::.              .:::::::::.
             Ý                        Ý                        Ý
        Diminishing                Summons                 Standard



  One more thing, although this is seperate from the rest of what we've
covered, but there's nowhere else it will fit.  There are three statuses in
the game that can cause you damage: Poison, Deadly Poison and Haunt.

  Poison causes you to take [Max HP / 10] damage at the end of your action.
Deadly Poison is more powerful, and causes you to take [Max HP / 5] damage
at the end of your action.  Be wary of these statuses.

  And Haunt is difficult to get rid of, and although not as bad as Poison,
it can be annoying.  It randomly takes effect when you damage an enemy, and
if it does, you will automatically be dealt 25% of the damage you hit the
enemy for.



Let's summarise now.

Relative Attack:
    Relative Attack = (User's Attack - Target's Defense).
    If (Relative Attack < 0), Relative Attack = 0.

Relative Power: 
    Relative Power = (User's Power - Target's Resist).
    If (Relative Power < -200), Relative Power = -200.
    If (Relative Power > 200), Relative Power = 200.

Basic Physical Attack:
    Base Damage = Relative Attack

Critical Hits:
    Damage = [Base Damage * 1.25] + [Target's Level / 5] + 6

Special Physical Attacks:
    Damage = [Base Damage * Mult Mod] + Add Mod
    If Elemental, Damage = [Damage * (1 + Relative Power / 400)]

Basic Psynergy Attacks:
    Psynergy has own Base Damage
    Damage = [Psynergy Base Damage * (1 + Relative Power / 200)]

Curative Psynergy:
    Psynergy has own Base Healing
    Healing = [Psynergy Base Healing * Caster's Power / 100]

Area Reduction:
    Basic Area Psynergy is reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%.
    Diminishing Area Psynergy is reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 50%, 30%, 10%, 10%, 10%.
    Summons are reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 70%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%.
    Physical Attacks are never reduced.
    A(ll) Target Psynergy is never reduced.
    Abilities that don't do normal damage are never reduced.

Random Damage:
    All attacks with Random Damage have a number between 0 to 3 added to them

Status Damage:
    Poison deals 10% of Max HP in damage per turn
    Deadly Poison deals 20% of Max HP in damage per turn
    Haunt causes you to randomly take 25% of the damage you dealt an enemy
      whenever you attack




IMPORTANT NOTE:
  Some fractions in this game are not used exactly as listed.  Instead,
Lost Age converts these fractions into one that has a denominator of 256.
As an example, 78/200 would be converted in this manner to:

       [(78 * 256) / 200]
     = [19968 / 200]
     = [99.84]
     =  99

Thus becoming 99/256.  For most things, this difference is not noticable,
especially after random damage.  However, for attacks like Summons against
high HP enemies, this small rounding error can become noticable if you're
bothering to try and estimate what you should be getting.

It's near impossible to list with certainty *all* the places the Lost Age
uses this rounding error.  Thus, no attempt will be made by this guide to do
so.  Power Multipliers seem to use it in particular.

You are thus warned to take this into account if you come across
inaccuracies.



======================
== WEAPON ABILITIES ==
======================
  Lost Age adds quite a large number of new artifacts, and with them come
new unleashes.  What follows is a list of every artifact weapon in the game,
complete with their unleashes.

  Each unleash has a base additional damage.  Damage listed in the form of
'xxx' are unleashes that use a Mult Mod of 1.00, and an Add Mod of xxx.
Damage listed in the form of 'mxxx%' are unleashes that use an Add Mod of 0
and a Mult Mod of xxx%.  The Swift Sword is marked '---' in the Dam stat;
this just means it has a Mult Mod of 1.00 and an Add Mod of 0.  All Weapon
Specials are considered to be Elemental Physical Attacks.

  The Rate of an unleash is the percentage chance it has of going off.  If
the Rate is listed as '---', then it has the default chance of 35%.  This is
worked out *BEFORE* chances for critical hits and other things are worked
out.  A few rare weapons have more than the default chance of unleash.  In
addition, the following equipment will add varying amounts to the percentage
chance of an unleash:

             Spiked Armor:     6%           Lucky Cap:        8%
             Erinyes Tunic:   10%           Warrior's Helm:  10%
             Mythril Clothes: 15%           Mythril Helm:    12%
             Valkyrie Mail:   20%           Demon Circlet:   15%

             Aegis Shield:    10%           Hyper Boots:     12%
             Mythril Armlet:  10%          *Ninja Sandals:   15%
             Riot Gloves:     20%

 * Don't ask about where to get this.  It's currently suspected to not be
   accessible in the game without a cheat device.

  It is indeed possible to reach 100% chance to unleash.


  Finally, some unleashes have a Special Effect, which is a random additional
effect that *may* take place on top of the normal damage the attack does.

======================
== DJINNI ABILITIES ==
======================
  As well as opening up advanced Classes and granting increased stats, Djinn
can be unleashed for that little extra power.  Each of the individual Djinni
abilities are listed here.

  The following abbreviations are used in this section:

  Elm: Element.  F=Fire, E=Earth, A=Air (Wind), W=Water.  
  Dam: Damage of the attack.  This was explained previously.
  Range: Radius of the attack.  A radius of 1 affects only the target it
         hits; 2 affects one extra target either side, while 3 affects two
         extra targets either side, or 5 targets altogether.  A radius of A
         means it has been coded to have no limit.
         A graphical indicator will also be shown to accurately reflect how
         the spells grow in power.
  Special: Any special effects the power has.

  Further explanation of the Dam codes are given here.

    xxx  : Damage follows normal Magical Attack rules.

   axxx  : The ability is considered to be an Elemental Physical Attack with
           a Mult Mod of 1 and an Add Mod equal to the number in the Dam
           column.

   mxxx% : The ability is considered to be an Elemental Physical Attack with
           an Add Mod of 0 and a Mult Mod equal to the number in the Dam
           column divided by 100; thus, 180% would be a Mult Mod of 1.8.


  Remember that Elemental Physical Attacks use Relative Attack as their Base
Damage, and have a range of 50% to 150%, instead of the 0% to 200% Magical
Attacks have.

Before we finish this section, we should cover Meld in more detail.

Meld selects your strongest companion out of the current active party to join
you in a double attack.  This attack is worked out as if it came from them,
not from the character unleashing Meld.

Their Attack is increased by 25% of the Meld Character's Attack, and they
then hit the target with an Elemental Physical Attack with 0 Add Mod and
1.0 Mult Mod.  The chosen companion's Earth Power is used in elemental
calculations.

Other than the percentage of Attack, the character using Meld adds nothing
more to the damage calculations.


Mold is similar; instead, the target is an enemy, who is then forced to
attack a random member of its team.  It uses an Earth Elemental Physical
Attack with 80 Add Mod and 1.0 Mult Mod, just as described above.  The person
unleashing the Djinni does no damage.


To summarise, Meld is an Earth EPA coming from the strongest out of the three
companions you have in battle, with their Attack given a bonus of 25% of the
Meld Character's Attack.  And Mold is an Earth EPA coming from the targeted
enemy, striking a random enemy.



===============================
== SUMMONS AND COMBO TABLETS ==
===============================
  Summons are essentially advanced Psynergy.  However, there's more to it
than that.

  By utilising combinations of Djinn that are on standby, you can unleash
powerful attacks.  These attacks draw on two things.  The first is the exact
combination of Djinn, which creates a basic Psynergy effect that applies as a
bonus to the second more important property: the target's maximum HP.

  The base damage of any Summon (with a few exceptions, as we'll see) can be
expressed like so:

    Base Damage = Summon Base + [Target's Max HP * 3 * Djinn Used / 100]


  In otherwords, for each Djinni used in the Summon, 3% of the target's Max
HP is added to the Base Damage.  This can really add up.



  Of course, this alone would fail to cause much damage, which is why we
return to the first factor: the actual Summon.

  At the start of the game, you have access to four basic Summons of each
element.  Naturally, you cannot use them until you have the Djinn to access
them, but they are there.

  Scattered around the game, however, are several combo tablets that open up
advanced summons, which require Djinn from two elements at once.  I will not
list their combinations and locations here; they are not really important for
this.

  In any case, depending on which combination you use, you will get one of
the below Summons, each with their own added effect to the damage.

  Once the Summon Base and element has been determined, we apply the
finishing touched: random variance and the Psynergy Power Multiplier factor
in, like all Magical damage.  In addition, they are all (with two exceptions)
magical area attacks that use the *SUMMON* diminishing ratio.  Since they do
not have a range of A(ll), they are subject to reduced damage against
off-centre targets.

  Having mentioned exceptions twice, we should take careful note of
Coatlicue, which does not cause damage to the enemy, and instead heals you
like a normal healing spell.  I have put the Damage Code of 'c' next to the
Summon Base for that summon to make that more clear.  In addition, summoning
Daedalus is another special case.  Although the actual Daedalus summon is a
normal summon in all respects, it also causes a second attack at the end of
the next turn, which I have, for the purposes of this guide, called
<Missile>.  This attack cannot be gotten on its own, and has its own special
rules that will be covered in its entry in the below table.



  And now, the summon effects themselves.  Both Base (the additional damage)
and HP% are displayed next to each summon, since those few exceptions who
don't use the above HP% formula do exist.

 Iris          F   800  40 |||||6||||| **Revives all 'Downed' and Restores HP

 * Missile is the second part of Daedalus' attack, which occurs at the end
   of the turn *after* the one in which it was summoned.  Although it is
   actually listed in the code as a Radius 6 attack, it does not suffer from
   Area Reduction.  In addition, it uses its own Power of 78 in the Power
   Multiplier.

 ** Iris' special affects all eight characters, even the four not in your
    active party.  It revives *any* 'Downed' members, restoring 100% Max HP
    in the process.  To everyone else, it restores 9999 HP using Fire Element
    and standard Curative formula.  The summoner's Fire Power applies to the
    strength of this curative power as well, though you'll likely never
    notice it unless you hack your Fire Power to something hideously low.

  Finally, after a Summon, your Element Power is raised by a certain amount
depending on the amount of Djinn of each type you used.  Using a Fire+Earth
Combo Summon would, for example, raise your Fire Power and Earth Power by a
predetermined amount, depending on the number of Fire and Earth Djinn
respectively used.  The below table details the amount and effect of using a
particular number of Djinn.

         Number of Djinn                 Effect
                1            Raises User's Power by  10 : 200 Max
                2            Raises User's Power by  30 : 200 Max
                3            Raises User's Power by  60 : 200 Max
                4+           Raises User's Power by 100 : 200 Max



========================
== PSYNERGY ABILITIES ==
========================
  The format of the following tables should be explained.

  In this section, the abilities able to be learned are displayed along with
their elements, effects, type, and more importantly, who learns them and
when.  It can be more useful to look through this list if you're looking for
a particular ability.

  The first part of each list details the effects and statistics of each
ability.  The abbreviations mean the following:

  Elm: Element.  F=Fire, E=Earth, A=Air (Wind), W=Water.  
  Dam: Damage of the attack.  This was explained previously.
  PP: Psynergy Point Cost.
  Range: Radius of the Psynergy.  A radius of 1 affects only the target
         it hits; 2 affects one extra target either side, while 3 affects two
         extra targets either side, or 5 targets altogether.  A radius of A
         means it has been coded to have no limit.
         A graphical indicator will also be shown to accurately reflect how
         the spells grow in power.
  Used: Where the spell can be used.  T=Town, D=Dungeons, B=Battle.
  Special: Any additional effects the Psynergy may have.
  Desc: Description of the spell (for the Misc Psynergy only)

  Further explanation of the Dam codes are given here.  If the figure in the
Dam column is just a straight number, then that is the Base Damage of a
Magical Attack.  Otherwise, the following codes are used:

   axxx  : The spell is considered to be an Elemental Physical Attack with a
           Mult Mod of 1 and an Add Mod equal to the number in the Dam
           column.

   mxxx% : The spell is considered to be an Elemental Physical Attack with an
           Add Mod of 0 and a Mult Mod equal to the number in the Dam column
           divided by 100; thus, 180% would be a Mult Mod of 1.8.

   cxxx  : The spell is Curative, and thus follows the Curative formula.
           The amount healed is thus Base Damage * User's Power / 100,
           plus Random Damage.

           Note: Curative abilities used outside of battle do not add Random
           Damage and always have a Power Multiplier of 1.

    xxxD : The spell is a standard Psynergy area attack, but follows the
           increased Diminishing formula, meaning it does far less damage to
           anything that is not the primary target of the spell.

    xxxs : The spell uses standard Magical Psynergy attack formula, but is
           part of a status spell.  As such, even the damage part may miss.
           (This only applies to two Psynergy that are available to players
            in the whole game, however)


  Remember that Elemental Physical Attacks use Relative Attack as their Base
Damage, and have a range of 50% to 150%, instead of the 0% to 200% Magical
Attacks have.


  In the second part of each ability list, the abilities will be listed one
by one, and who learns them will be displayed to the right.  Let us take
Revive as an example.

  According to the list, Revive is learnt at level 19 by Earth characters
(Isaac and Felix) as a Gallant, Savage, Shaman or Swordsman, or anything that
inherits those classes.  Likewise, Fire characters (Garet and Jenna) learn it
at level 19 in Savage, as do Wind and Water characters in Shaman and Medium.
However, Wind/Water characters can also learn it at level 17 when in White
Mage.

  The jobs that learn it are split into five categories: the four main
character elements, and Item.  The elements refer to the primary element of
each character, so Earth means both Isaac and Felix, while Wind refers to
Sheba and Ivan.  Item refers to classes that are only available through use
of the three class-changing items that exist in the game.

  If I do not specify which version of a job (example: Swordsman (E)) can
learn an ability, then I mean all versions of that job within that primary
element can learn it.  Earth characters, for example, cannot use
Swordsman (F), so Swordsman obviously refers to Swordsman (E).  As another
example, Wind characters can change into both Enchanter (E) and
Enchanter (F), but some Psynergy are shared between these jobs and learnt at
the same level.  For these, just Enchanter under the Wind category is enough
to refer to both.

  A great number of spells run in series; in this case, the series will use
the name of the lowest spell in the series, and the levels required for all
three spells follow the respective classes.  Taking Cure as an example, a
Earth character Squire learns Cure at level 1, Cure Well at level 10 and
Potent Cure at level 26.

  Finally, abilities that are considered upgrades list which spell they
upgrade in place of when you learn them.  The layout of the table should make
it reasonably easy to derive when you should have them, in any case.


  Please take care to remember that only the base class will be indicated
when determining where a spell is found.  Any class that inherits that base
class will not be shown in this list.

  !!NOTE!!  There are two abilities called Blast in the game, each with
different effects.  The Blast in the Blast/Nova/Supernova series will be
identified as Blast(Nova).

================
== ITEM USAGE ==
================
  Certain items may be used in or outside battle to create an effect.  Most
duplicate the effect of an already existing Psynergy.  Some have unique
effects.  Some items can only be used once before disappearing, while others
may be used until they randomly break.  There are many differences between
the various items in the game.  This section, however, will only focus on
the used items' *effect*.

  Item usage has one large difference from Psynergy in terms of damage
mechanics.  If the item has an elemental effect, it will *not* use the
character's Power in that element.  For all respects and purposes, the Power
of the item is counted as 100.  The target's Resist may or may not be taken
into account depending on the effect of the item.

  Using the previous section's layout and codes, here are the details of all
the usable items in the game.

=============
== THE END ==
=============
  Sorry, no Further Analysis section for now.  Most of what was said in the
previous Golden Sun guide still holds, of course, but I lack the time to
update it for Lost Age at the moment, and besides, anything I write about
strategy will soon be further refined and surpassed by the denizens of the
GameFAQs message boards.

  Just remember.  The important thing is not what the best setup ever is...
it's to figure out what the best setup for *you* is.  Playing style is
everything, whether you rely on weapons, Psynergy, special classes, summons,
or sheer variety.

  I hope this document's helped.
