# golden-sun
Various data etc. collected for the Golden Sun GBA games

This is a pet project of mine, which was basically inspired by architecture such as LAMP.
These games are the best, and I always wanted a kind of sandbox to test out hypothetical builds etc, as well as collect all of the useful data out in various places together.

To do this, I'll basically be creating a python program/script to make calculations according to the game mechanics.
This will refer to a MySQL database which holds info on stats, monsters, abilities etc.

# FAQ
- Isn't it overkill to build it in this way?—
*Almost certainly, but I want to learn how to do this anyway so that's irrelevant*
- Where have you got all this data from?—
*`credit.txt` is more precise but basically from [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gba/561356-golden-sun-the-lost-age/faqs) and the [Golden Sun Wiki](http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Sun_Wiki).
Special shoutout to Terence Ferguson's guide on GameFAQs.*
- Can I use this?—
*Sure, go ahead. If someone else finds this useful (once it's finished!) I'll be happy to have helped a fellow fan :) Just don't go and pass it off as yours, ok?*
- I have comments/suggestions—
*I'm all ears! Drop me an email or whatever. I've never actually interacted with anyone on GitHub, just pushed stuff out, so it would be welcome.*
