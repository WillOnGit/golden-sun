STATS
=====

The stat you actually see is worked out in the following manner:
(Base Stat + Djinni Bonuses + Equip Bonus) * Class Bonus


(Character goals DONE + Djinni bonuses DONE + Item bonuses PARTIALLY DONE) * Class Bonus DONE

================
ELEMENTS/CLASSES
================

All the characters start off with 5 levels in a particular element, and 0
levels in all others. This can be found as the element in the database.

Each level in a particular element grants you an extra +5 Power and +5 Resist to that element.
You gain an additional Element Level for each Djinni you equip of that element.

In addition to having starting elemental levels, each character has the
following base Power and Resist for each element, depending on their own
primary element.  (Note that this does *not* include the +25 to Power and
Resist the character gets for the element they have L5 in.)

                 Earth        Water          Fire          Wind
   Primary   Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist
    Earth      79    89      78    88      76    86      77    87
    Water      78    88      79    89      77    87      76    86
    Fire       76    86      77    87      79    89      78    88
    Wind       77    87      76    86      78    88      79    89



Now for Dominance.  First, we define each elements relationship with the
others.  Please keep in mind though, that these are story-based
relationships; they don't really have that much to do with actual damage,
which we will be covering later:

Primary   Neutral   Weakness  Affinity
Earth     Water      Wind      Fire
Water     Earth      Fire      Wind
Fire      Wind     Water     Earth
Wind      Fire     Earth     Water

Primary dominates Neutral dominates Weakness dominates Affinity

At any time, you will have two dominant elements: First Dominant and Second
Dominant. The element in which you have the highest Elemental Level is your
First Dominant, and your second highest is your Second Dominant.  Ties are,
of course, worked out by the above Dominance order.

 1. If you have only Primary Djinn set, you will receive a class from the
      Basic Element Classes.
  a. Jenna and Piers are exceptions, and instead receive their class from the
       Lost Age New Classes table.
 2. If the above doesn't hold (you have at least one non-Primary Djinni set)
      then we check if your Affinity Element is either your First or Second
      Dominant.  If it is, you will receive a class from the Earth/Fire Table
      or the Wind/Water Table, depending on which group your Affinity is
      from.
 3. Otherwise, we pick from the table aligned with your Secondary Dominant.
      It is impossible for any character to be able to select a class from
      the table aligned solely with their Affinity Element, as seen by the
      rules above.

There is one final exception: if you have an Class Item equipped, then
you will be forced into the relevant class from the Class Item Table.
Mysterious Card pushes you into the Pierrot group, Trainer's Whip into the
Tamer group, and Tomegathericon into the Dark Mage (I) group.

PSYNERGY
========

INHERENT PSYNERGY

Felix            Retreat, Move, Sand (Learned in Gaia Rock)
Piers            Douse, Parch (Learned in Aqua Rock)
Jenna            Blaze (Learned in Magma Rock)
Sheba            Mind Read, Reveal (Learned in Air's Rock)
Isaac            Retreat, Move
Mia              ---
Garet            Move
Ivan             Mind Read, Reveal

Psynergy is inherited from lower ranks of the same class family. Therefore, to
find out which psynergy a character has at a given time:

1. Find the lowest rank of the current class family for that character
2. Use the 'upgrades' (name might change) column of DB to check psynergy
     a. Each part of the string looks like 1:Cure ==> if character level >=1, it knows cure.
     b. Do this for each part of the string
3. Repeatedly process the 'upgrades' column for other class ranks up to the current class rank
     a. The [name:newname] indicates that psynergy 'name' is upgrade to psynergy 'newname'

=======================
== DAMAGE OF ATTACKS ==
=======================

Relative Attack:
    Relative Attack = (User's Attack - Target's Defense).
    If (Relative Attack < 0), Relative Attack = 0.

Relative Power: 
    Relative Power = (User's Power - Target's Resist).
    If (Relative Power < -200), Relative Power = -200.
    If (Relative Power > 200), Relative Power = 200.

Basic Physical Attack:
    Base Damage = Relative Attack

Critical Hits:
    Damage = [Base Damage * 1.25] + [Target's Level / 5] + 6

Special Physical Attacks:
    Damage = [Base Damage * Mult Mod] + Add Mod
    If Elemental, Damage = [Damage * (1 + Relative Power / 400)]

Basic Psynergy Attacks:
    Psynergy has own Base Damage
    Damage = [Psynergy Base Damage * (1 + Relative Power / 200)]

Curative Psynergy:
    Psynergy has own Base Healing
    Healing = [Psynergy Base Healing * Caster's Power / 100]

Area Reduction:
    Basic Area Psynergy is reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%.
    Diminishing Area Psynergy is reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 50%, 30%, 10%, 10%, 10%.
    Summons are reduced by the ratio:
      100%, 70%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%.
    Physical Attacks are never reduced.
    A(ll) Target Psynergy is never reduced.
    Abilities that don't do normal damage are never reduced.

Random Damage:
    All attacks with Random Damage have a number between 0 to 3 added to them

Status Damage:
    Poison deals 10% of Max HP in damage per turn
    Deadly Poison deals 20% of Max HP in damage per turn
    Haunt causes you to randomly take 25% of the damage you dealt an enemy
      whenever you attack




IMPORTANT NOTE:
  Some fractions in this game are not used exactly as listed.  Instead,
Lost Age converts these fractions into one that has a denominator of 256.
As an example, 78/200 would be converted in this manner to:

       [(78 * 256) / 200]
     = [19968 / 200]
     = [99.84]
     =  99

Thus becoming 99/256.  For most things, this difference is not noticable,
especially after random damage.  However, for attacks like Summons against
high HP enemies, this small rounding error can become noticable if you're
bothering to try and estimate what you should be getting.

=======
SUMMONS
=======

Base Damage = Summon Base + [Target's Max HP * 3 * Djinn Used / 100]

Exceptions exist to the HP % part, but the rule of thumb is 3% of HP per djinni.
