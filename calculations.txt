'Physics'

The stat you actually see is worked out in the following manner:
(Base Stat + Djinni Bonuses + Equip Bonus) * Class Bonus



(Character goals DONE + Djinni bonuses DONE + Item bonuses NOT DONE) * Class Bonus NOT DONE



All the characters start off with 5 levels in a particular element, and 0
levels in all others.  The characters and their respective elements are:

Name     Element
Felix    Earth
Piers    Water
Jenna    Fire
Sheba    Wind

Isaac    Earth
Mia      Water
Garet    Fire
Ivan     Wind



In addition to having starting elemental levels, each character has the
following base Power and Resist for each element, depending on their own
primary element.  (Note that this does *not* include the +25 to Power and
Resist the character gets for the element they have L5 in.)

                 Earth        Water          Fire          Wind
   Primary   Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist  Power Resist
    Earth      79    89      78    88      76    86      77    87
    Water      78    88      79    89      77    87      76    86
    Fire       76    86      77    87      79    89      78    88
    Wind       77    87      76    86      78    88      79    89



Now for Dominance.  First, we define each elements relationship with the
others.  Please keep in mind though, that these are story-based
relationships; they don't really have that much to do with actual damage,
which we will be covering later:

Primary   Neutral   Weakness  Affinity
Earth     Water      Wind      Fire
Water     Earth      Fire      Wind
Fire      Wind     Water     Earth
Wind      Fire     Earth     Water

Primary dominates Neutral dominates Weakness dominates Affinity
