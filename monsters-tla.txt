The only place I am letting this guide be posted is on GameFAQs.
Don't go stealing my guide, ok?

My email is torrentlord@gmail.com.

If you emailed me before, your email was probably deleted.
I don't check email requently, so don't expect a response.
If you do get one, that's nice. I don't usually check it.

I'm not going to let you use my guide somewhere else. Sorry, only GameFAQs.

On another important note, (I guess I forgot to include this),
in Hard Mode, HP is x1.5, and Att/Def are x1.25. That's it.

*Stone Soldier's Elixir ICC is unknown to me, because I took CobraGT's word*
*that Stone Soldiers drop Elixirs. Since I didn't get this information as I*
*did the other information, I can't determine without testing, which I have*
*no patience to do. If I ever get a Windows, I'll update this again. Sorry.*

ups  ``` Section I -- Updates ```
     ````````````````````````````

Version 0.01 [Late Spring '03]
--- This was when I originally started the guide.
--- Barely ANYTHING was done.
--- Enemies: Approx. 10

Version 0.25 [March '04]
--- I resumed the project I put off for so long.
--- Enemies: Approx. 40

Version 0.30 [Mid March '04]
--- I finally came up with two ideas to speed this up;
    Always Item Drop Code, and...
    Enemy Takes Lots Of Turns Code.
--- Enemies: Approx. 75

Version 0.50 [March 23, '04]
--- Enemies: 101

Version 1.00 [April 1, '04]
--- I get tired of my old method, and go inside to game.
    Lo and behold, there are all the enemy stats.
    I go through the game only collecting the enemy's ID.
--- I should have all the enemies by now.
    If I'm missing some, let me know.

Versions 1.40 [April 2, '04]
--- Fixed some really strange Doom Dragon errors.
--- Combined all of the split enemies.
    (Eg: Karst/Agatio, Moapa/Knights, Serpent, Doom Dragon)
--- I completed and added the rankings by the six main stats,
    and the by the average of all of those six.
--- I'll eventually get to Elemental Grouping.

Versions 1.50 [April 11, '04]
--- Elemental Grouping is really useless,
    and this file is large enough already.
--- OMG! I forgot the Gressil!
    I never even knew about Izumo Ruins till now.
    I guess it's good to go and explore.


Versions 1.53 [Sept 10, '04]
--- Corrected a couple of errors,
    the Wild Gryphon/Stone Soldier drops.
    Thanks to CobraGT.

its  ```  Section II - Intro  ```
     ````````````````````````````

You wanna know why it says &quot;its&quot; next to this section?
Or why in the Table of Contents it ALSO says &quot;its&quot;,
next to this section's name?

Since this isn't a web site where you can just click
&quot;Back to Top&quot;, or click on a link to scroll down for you,
it might be hard navigating through this.

Also, some section titles look different than they do in the ToC.
So if you want to go somewhere quick, Ctrl (Command) F those 3 letters.

FYI, I'm not seperating types of enemies. (Normal, boss, etc.)

And the rank by stats is just for the curious.

Now, for location. It's quite simple. Every time I find an enemy,
the area's number is in the location section. If there is a number,
then an &quot;a&quot;, then that means the location is split up into 2
(or more) enemy areas, and some enemies can't be found in the
first area, while are there in the second.

My definitions:

World Map A - From Dalia to a spot right before
              the front entrance to the Dehkan Plateau.
World Map B - From the end of World Map A to
              Osenia Cliffs and Gondowan Cliffs.
World Map C - Anywhere on Osenia that can be reached on land
              via the Osenia Cliffs.
World Map D - Anywhere on Gondowan that can be reached on land
              via the Gondowan Cliffs.
World Map E - Mid-game areas. For Example:
              Yallam, Apojii, Izumo, and Champa World Maps.
World Map F - Tundaria / E Tundaria Islet World Maps.
              Not very many World Maps of this kind.
World Map G - Any World Map on the West side of Weyard.
              Also, Treasure Isle World Map.

Trial Road (Top) - The battle on top, with Moapa and his Knights.

Trial Road (Bottom) - The area reachable with Hover.

I give you...my enemy list.


     ````````````````````````````
enm  `` Section III -- Enemies ``
     ````````````````````````````
An &quot;a&quot; after a number denotes that
the enemy can only be found in the
interior or the latter part of the
area that the number represents.
Bosses/Mini-Bosses not included.
